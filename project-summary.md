# Multi-Platform Movie Streaming App
## Project Summary

---

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, MongoDB
- **Storage:** AWS S3 (for videos, thumbnails, trailers)

---

### Key Features & Progress

#### 1. Movie Upload & S3 Integration
- Admins can upload movies, thumbnails, and trailers directly to S3
- S3 bucket policies allow public access for thumbnails/trailers
- Backend supports `trailerUrl` and handles trailer uploads

#### 2. Admin Panel
- Modern, dark-themed dashboard for managing users and movies
- Consistent, visually polished tables and forms
- Admins can toggle "featured" status for movies
- All `cast`-related logic and fields have been removed

#### 3. Homepage & Movie Grid
- Full-width, auto-playing trailer carousel (cycles every 10s)
- Movies grouped by genre, with large, cinematic thumbnails
- Responsive, minimal-gap grid with bold, accented section titles

#### 4. Movie Card & Navigation
- Modern cards: rounded, shadowed, play icon overlay on hover
- Correct Next.js `Link` usage for navigation (no nested `<a>`)
- Navigation issues resolved

#### 5. Movie Details Page
- Large poster, genre/year/rating badges, prominent play button
- Consistent dark theme and layout

#### 6. Trailer Player
- Auto-cycles trailers every 10 seconds (timer-based)
- Overlayed description with semi-transparent background
- Reduced trailer display height for better balance

#### 7. UI/UX Overhaul
- Global dark theme, Inter font, blue accent
- Smooth transitions, rounded corners, gradients, drop shadows
- All forms, tables, and navigation are visually consistent

#### 8. Dependency Management
- Attempted to update Next.js/React to latest versions
- Blocked by `react-hls-player` peer dependency (requires React 16.x)

---

### Issues Addressed
- S3 permissions and public access
- Trailer support in upload forms and backend
- Modernized movie grid, cards, and admin panel
- Navigation and Link usage fixed
- Removed unused `cast` field (fixed JSON.parse errors)
- Dark mode styling for all forms and tables

---

### Outstanding/Recent Issues
- **Dependency conflict:** `react-hls-player` requires React 16.x, blocking Next.js/React upgrades
- **Future upgrades** may require replacing or updating `react-hls-player`

---

### Overall
- The app now features a modern, CADF-like UI/UX, robust admin tools, and a consistent dark theme
- All major technical and visual issues are resolved
- Only dependency management (for future upgrades) remains as a challenge
